This branch contains a variant that uses only 1.5u modifiers and alps switchs.

# Features
- Exactly same layout as original HHKB pro 2 (especially 6u space bar).
- Compatible with [TMK firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard).
- Comaptible with any Cherry MX copy switches.
- Single sided board with SMD components
- Wide tracks(excellent for home fabrication)
